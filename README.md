# Decomposition of Differentials in Health Expectancies from Multistate Life Tables
***Tianyu Shen, Tim Riffe, Collin F. Payne and Vladimir Canudas-Romo***

This is a repository for our paper in [*Demography*](https://doi.org/10.1215/00703370-11058373){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

Details of the mathematical derivations and the demographic interpretation of the results are included in our paper.

The code is available in "**code.R**".

Our example data are authors' calculated from the HRS. They are stored in folder "**RMLE**". Inside this folder, there are two files:

- "**BASELINE.csv**" includes the initial health structure of the population. The columns are explained below

**state**: health state (with 1 and 2, healthy and unhealthy respectively)

**ragender**: gender

**pro**: proportion of the population in that health state (they are rescaled to 1 by sex and iteration to calculated the HLE for male and female separately)

**iter**: bootstrap iteration number

- "**PROB.csv**" includes the transition probabilities by age. The columns are explained below

**pre_state**: the initial state

**ragender**: gender

**age**: age

**iter**: bootstrap iteration number

**A**: probability to "Healthy" given the initial state

**L**: probability to "Unhealthy" given the initial state

**H**: probability to "Death" given the initial state
